Legacy fork

About
=====
This repository contains an extended version of [Smack](http://www.igniterealtime.org/projects/smack/). It's primary used by [aSmack](https://github.com/Flowdalic/asmack), to build an Android version of Smack. But since aSmack just changes some stuff and adds patches on top of a Smack branch, these branches can be used also in non-Android environments.

Branches
========

- master
- xep0198
- upstream
- smack-aiv smack from [a-iv](https://github.com/a-iv), who contributed here too.
- dnssec (DNSSEC patches on top of master)
- maybe some other branches to test new patches

master
--------------
The current state of Smack trunk, plus additional patches.

### Additional non-upstream (yet) patches

History
=======
This fork of smack was initiated by Rene Treffer for the [aSmack build environment](http://code.google.com/p/asmack/), in order to get Smack working on Android for the [buddycloud project](https://buddycloud.org/). aSmack on Googlecode is now inactive. Before the project was abdoned, Rene migrated the data from Googlecode to GitHub. This is where I forked his repo and started working on aSmack, mostly janitorial tasks, but I also merged smack 3.2.0 and keep master in sync with upstream.
